# Falling Blocks

## About

This is a fun project that I started to experiment with a game idea that I had.
 
The player should combine the falling blocks to create continguous rows.
The game engine works against the player by generating blocks having the least optimal shape.

## Built with
The project is entirely wrote in Python and based on the library Pygame.
